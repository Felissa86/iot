School assignment from Leidse Onderwijs Instellingen

Made in 25 august 2023

Goal was to make a smart doorbell with a raspberry pi. 
When you ring the doorbell, you get a message on your phone through IFTTT. If an intruder would come in, the sensor would go off and you get an alarm. 

It was a hard assignment especially for somebody who had no expierence with python, but with the help of a voluntaliry teacher I passed it.
